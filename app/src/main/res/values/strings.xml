<center><h2> Recurr The Relation </h2></center>
<center><p>The idea of game is...<br>
Having four or five functions on different part of table( written as code )..<br>
Some having function.. some random value( stack of paper having different value) ... <br>
It is like playing with many recursion in a cup.</p></center>
<center><h2> Believe Your Senses </h2></center>
<center><p>This game is based on sound.... <br>
Different sound means different things... <br>
Like turn left..turn right... Colors.. red.. Blue... Like that...<br>
We make a string of sounds.. (having previous meaning).... <br>
They have to tell from previous location where they are and what color is there shirt and what direction is their previous location<br>
.It basically depend on audio.<br>
</p></center>
<center><h2> How it Resembles </h2></center>
<center><p>We will provide many objects in a loot which would relate to specific entities in CSE world and participants need to pick objects under the topic alloted...<br>

Ex: A pack of shuttle cork represents a Stack as it can be taken out and entered from top
